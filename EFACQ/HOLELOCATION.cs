/// <summary>
/// The HoleLocation table is the entry point for data in an acQuire database. The data in this table is either the collar details of drillholes or the name of a geochemical sampling program. The primary key fields are HoleID and ProjectCode. Drillholes, costeans, downhole geotechnical surveys or face samples are considered to be linear samples and are classified as HoleType= DRILLHOLE. In a work program there probably would be numerous HoleID(s) associated with a ProjectCode. For example: HoleID = DDH013, DDH014 or DDH015 ProjectCode = King River HoleType = DRILLHOLE For geochemical or pit geotechnical samples (ie point samples but, NOT downhole point samples such as geotech drilling - they would be defined as DRILLHOLE) the HoleType would be GEOCHEM. In this case the HoleID would probably reflect the sampling type/method or program name.  For example: HoleID = BLEG97 (a sampling program) ProjectCode = King River HoleType = GEOCHEM SampleID = M03451, M03452 or M03453 and so on (SampleID are entered into the Sample table).
