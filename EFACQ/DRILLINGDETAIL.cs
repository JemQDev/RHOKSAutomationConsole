/// <summary>
/// DrillingDetail stores information on drilling activities and that quantifies that activity - cost per metre, metres drilled, surveys taken for example. This table is the main table of the Events compound form definition. For example, the drilling company has a contract to charge $24.50 per metre for RC and 30m were drilled. The input would look like this: Name = RC4 Defined in DrillingActivity  with CostCode = BX12 Defined in Cost  Value = 30 metres  ContractCode = Ace95 Defined in Contract  Thus there is a relationship between the activity, the costcode and the contract company - for company and government reporting, for budgeting and cost analysis.
