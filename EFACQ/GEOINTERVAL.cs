/// <summary>
/// GeoInterval can be used to associate an interval (GeolFrom to GeolTo) in a particular drillhole (HoleID) with particulars (GeolCode(s)) about that interval. It is the main table of the Geology compound form definition.  You might like to establish the GeologyCodePrimary first (this is optional) and then the virtual fields that are viewed in a Geology form. The GeologyCodePrimary is usually a general category or classification e.g. Mineralization, Lithology, Structure and so on. The associated virtual fields (GeologyCodeSecondary) can be a subset of the GeologyCodePrimary e.g. Alteration, Sulphides, % Fracturing, Quartz Veining, Weathering and so on. It is a bit like a tree structure - the GeologyCodePrimary is the trunk and the GeologyCodeSecondary(s) are the branches. The Name(s) are the leaves. Store downhole point information (such as geotechnical readings). As above but the GeolFrom and GeolTo would be equal - to define a point in space. For example: GeologyCodePrimary = Mineralztn and there are three SecondaryCodes: GeologyCodeSecondary = Min1 (major)
