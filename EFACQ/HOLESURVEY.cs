/// <summary>
/// HoleSurvey stores downhole survey information - as the azimuth and / or dip the drillhole deviates. There are references to the type of survey; this could be a record of the instrument to undertake the survey e.g. Eastman single shot or digital gyroscope. The azimuth type could be a record of the format of the reading - if degrees, minutes and seconds or in decimal degrees; if a magnetic reading or relative to local grid. The Priority could be used to assign reliability to the data. The dip must be between -90 and 90.  It is recommended that the measured or the highest quality survey is stored in HoleSurvey.Azimuth, and that transformed azimuths are stored in virtual fields in SurveyAzimuth.
